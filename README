= zosc

A work in progress that comes with no warranty

== DESCRIPTION:

A "one to all" style open sound control router using zeroconf DNS service discovery (aka Bonjour, MDNS)

== SYNOPSIS:

Registers on port 9092 as a zeroconf _osc._udp service

Messages received on port 9090 are routed via unicast to other instances of the software on the network via port 9092
Messages received on port 9090 are routed to localhost port 9091
Messages received on port 9092 from the network are routed to localhost port 9091

See the Max MSP 5 example patcher for a demo.

== REQUIREMENTS

<del>This should be cross platform because of the ruby gems used</del> dnssd gem cannot currently be built for windows https://github.com/tenderlove/dnssd/issues#issue/4
Untested on everything but OS X 10.6
Ruby 1.9.1+ or JRuby
dnssd gem https://github.com/tenderlove/dnssd
ruby-osc gem https://github.com/maca/ruby-osc

OS X install instructions: 

OS X Developer tools must be installed http://developer.apple.com/xcode/

A local copy of git installed to clone the project, I use Homebrew http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew for my dependencies

	$ brew install git

Ruby 1.9.1+ or JRuby is needed for the gems used and I recommend latest stable release (see http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ )
OS X 10.6 comes with Ruby 1.8.7 pre installed and we can manage multiple installs of ruby with RVM

	$ sudo gem update --system #the version of rubygems that comes with 10.6 is a bit outdated so update it
	$ sudo gem install rvm  #follow on screen instructions to add it to your ~/.bash_profile then start a new terminal
	$ rvm install 1.9.2 #latest at time of writing
	$ rvm use 1.9.2 #do this for each terminal window you want to run a different version of ruby in
	$ ruby -v #check current ruby version
	$ sudo gem install dnssd
	$ sudo gem install ruby-osc 
	$ cd /some/working/dir 
	$ git clone git://github.com/samBiotic/zosc.git
        $ cd zosc
	$ ruby zosc.rb #eventmachine may say it isn't initialised, if so run it again $ !!
	
* Now send any osc message to the network via localhost on port 9090 and receive from the network on on port 9091
* Quit zosc with /exit message sent to localhost 9090
* Enjoy!
