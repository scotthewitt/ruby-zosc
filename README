= zosc

A work in progress

== DESCRIPTION:

Open Sound Control router using zeroconf DNS Service Discovery (aka Bonjour, MDNS)

== SYNOPSIS:

run with
$ruby zosc.rb

Registers as _osc._udp on port 9092 as a zeroconf service

All messages received on port 9092 from the network are also routed to localhost port 9091.

All messages received on port 9090 are routed to localhost port 9091 and via unicast to all other instances of the software on port 9092

See the Max MSP 5 example patcher for a demo.

== REQUIREMENTS & INSTALL:

* Ruby 1.9.1 or JRuby
* gem install dnssd
* gem install ruby-osc
* This should be cross platform because of the ruby gems used, but is untested on everything but OS X 10.6

* OS X install instructions: 
* A local copy of git installed to clone the project 
* Ruby 1.9.1 or JRuby is needed for the gems used
* OS X 10.6 comes with Ruby 1.8.7 preinstalled, so we can manage multiple installs of ruby with RVM http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/
* I recommend Homebrew http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew for dependancies

	* sudo gem update --system #the version of rubygems that comes with Snow Leopard is a bit outdated so update it.
	* sudo sudo gem install rvm 
	* rvm-install #follow on screen instructions to add it to your ~/.bash_profile
	* rvm install 1.9.1 #this may take a while
	* rvm use 1.9.1 #do this for each terminal window you want to run a different version of ruby in
	* ruby -v #check current ruby version
	* sudo gem install dnssd
	* sudo gem install ruby-osc
	* brew install git 
	* cd /some/working/dir 
	* git clone git://github.com/samBiotic/zosc.git
	* ruby zosc.rb #sometimes eventmachine complains it isn't initialised but keep running the command until it asks for your name
	
* Now send any osc message on port 9090 and receive on port 9091
* Enjoy!
